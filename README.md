# DMG-Snake

Yet another snake game.

This is a practice project and I didn't plan to improve it beyond a playable prototype for now, or forever.

## How to Play

**THIS IS A GAME BOY ROM.** Load it with an emulator (or even manufacture a cart for a real console) to play.

If you don't have one, take a look at [bgb](http://bgb.bircd.org/), it's powerful and small.

After you opened the game, press any arrow key to start.

Arrow keys to move, other keys are not used.
